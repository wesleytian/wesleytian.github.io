<div><span id="tag"><a href="/tags/blog">blog</a></span><span id="tag"><a href="/tags/story">story</a></span></div><hr/><p>Just a few days ago, I was debating with my co-workers Ty and Anish about whether or not having more information is helpful for making better decisions. I&rsquo;m not going to be able to express their arguments with high fidelity, so I will only express mine here.</p>

<p>I think having more information does not allow us to make better decisions. In fact, I think a lot of the time, we can benefit from having less information. A few examples that we discussed included the famous story of George Dantzig, who believed that two questions he saw on the board were homework questions and solved them; only later did he discover that he had solved two famous unsolved statistics questions.</p>

<p>If he hadn&rsquo;t walked into the classroom late that day and heard that it was a famous unsolved question, he probably wouldn&rsquo;t have even tried to solve the question.</p>

<p>Another example that came up in real life was just yesterday at work. I had been working on updating TensorFlow from 1.0 to 1.8 and my mentor told me that I would need to overhaul an LSTM model before the upgrade could be completed. Because of my mentor&rsquo;s authority and perceived knowledge, I didn&rsquo;t give what he said any second thought and just accepted it.</p>

<p>However, Anish wasn&rsquo;t told this and because he wanted to use some features of 1.8 pretty badly, he tried to upgrade it to 1.8 anyways. In this way, without the information given to him from a position in higher power first, he never gave a second thought about trying to upgrade it himself. Lo and behold, we didn&rsquo;t actually need to touch the LSTM model before the upgrade and the request was merged late last night.</p>

<p>As you can see, I think that many statistics such as how unlikely it is for you to start a company and bring it to IPO only prevent people from succeeding. The best way to go about this is to have a positive attitude and try your best to ignore the negative facts.</p>
