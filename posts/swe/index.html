<div><span id="tag"><a href="/tags/blog">blog</a></span><span id="tag"><a href="/tags/story">story</a></span></div><hr/><p>I&rsquo;ve recently learned some interesting things about being a software engineer which you don&rsquo;t really learn in school at all. They are a totally disjoint from the set of skills that you gain from your classes.</p>

<ol>
<li>Nobody knows the answer. But it&rsquo;s out there somewhere. It&rsquo;s up to you and only you to figure it out. That&rsquo;s what the company is paying you to do. Problem-solve.</li>
</ol>

<p>When my internship first started, I rapidly shot questions at my mentor, full-timers, and interns to catch up to speed. After a while, I realized that they didn&rsquo;t know the answer to my questions anymore. Either we would figure it out on the spot together, or they would try to give me the most guidance they could (usually not much), and then the rest was left up to me to figure it out.</p>

<p>In school, we have a completely reversed dichotomy where you are able to ask your professor anything about the class and get a fairly accurate answer. But in the workplace, there&rsquo;s no such thing. This is because when you work, you are doing active research, you aren&rsquo;t just taking in facts and spitting it back out again.</p>

<ol>
<li>Take it slow. Learning takes time, debugging takes time, and sometimes detours are necessary. It&rsquo;s a SWE skill to be able to determine how long the detour is. As an intern, you tend to try to decrease this detour as much as possible to get as much done as possible, but as I&rsquo;ve learned, it&rsquo;s not the most optimal schedule. Instead, you should try to increase your time on detours to provide a more solid foundation for later.</li>
</ol>

<p>What I mean by a detour is the path that you take to figure out a problem such as an Error or a bug. It usually requires a lot of googling, Stack Overflow, documentation, amongst other things. I think that if you spend more time actually learning why something works instead of just copying and pasting code, you will make seemingly slower progress at first, but soon realize that you&rsquo;ve actually been creating a better foundation for yourself that will benefit you in the long-run. It&rsquo;s more or less about investing your time in the right place for future benefits.</p>

<p>For example, instead of just copying a Linux command from some website and running it, I now take apart each command and flag and learn what each one does. This means that in the future, I&rsquo;ll be able to use those commands in my own way instead of having to search online again and again for the similar commands/flags. (My other blog post (coming soon) is an active example of what I am doing.)</p>
