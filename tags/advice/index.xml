      <description>1. Change your graduation date Imagine it&amp;rsquo;s currently fall 2019. You were recently admitted into college last fall and expect to graduate in spring 2023. A student who has enough credits to be a junior and puts down an expected graduation date of Dec. 2018 or May 2018 instead of May 2019 will give them an enormous edge in the resume screening process. This is because companies give priority to juniors since it is easier to convert them into full-time employees.</description>

      <description>1. Take classes with the course chair Taking classes with the course chair for courses with many sections such as Linear Algebra guarantees you a proficient teacher.

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all heard this quote before:
 “You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.” – Jim Rohn
 Do your friends define who you are? Take a moment to ponder this thought.
Initially, the answer is no. You are yourself and there is nobody who can learn who you are by being around your friends. We are each too unique to be defined that way.</description>

Your brain works in strange ways and to appeal to your brain you have to take advantage of how your brain works.</description>
