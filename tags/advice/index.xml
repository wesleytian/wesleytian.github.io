      <description>1. Take classes with the course chair Taking classes with the course chair for courses with multiple sections such as Linear Algebra guarantees you a proficient teacher. They will most likely provide extra perks such as review sessions and review sheets. You are also guaranteed that the instructor will cover everything on the tests so you won&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about your professor omitting something.
I took Calculus I with the course chair my freshman year.</description>

      <title>Defined by Your Friends</title>

      <description>Do your friends define who you are? Take a moment to ponder this thought.
Initially, the answer is no. You are yourself and there is nobody who can learn who you are by just being around your friends. We are each too unique to be defined that way. Conversely, what if I told you that you were shaped by your friends? You were nurtured by the people you&amp;rsquo;ve met and seen, the conversations and events you shared with your friends.</description>

      <description>Sometimes you just don’t feel like going to the gym. For one reason or another, the real reason is just because you’re too lazy and don’t feel like it. Don’t make excuses. But that’s another point.
Listen up, because I’m going to teach you a way that has made everything for me easier. It should work for anything that you’ve been doing routinely, but just can’t keep it that way. Your brain works in strange ways and in order to appeal to your brain you have to take advantage of how your brain works.</description>
