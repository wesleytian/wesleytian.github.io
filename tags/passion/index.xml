      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve often been told that passion leads to success. It is one thing to hear a quote and another thing entirely to experience it firsthand. This summer, I was hired as an intern by Ray (Rui) Wang, a computer science professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst as well as the founder of Ray&amp;rsquo;s Hobby and OpenSprinkler.

      <description>What is your passion? I was asked this question by my professor nonchalantly while having a light conversation. It seemed like a simple question at first. However, after deeply thinking about it, I realized that I did not have an answer. I answered with &amp;ldquo;well, I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about a lot of things. I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about the environment, and about other things.&amp;rdquo; Compared to him, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t even really passionate about the environment.</description>
