      <description>Summary:  Command line AI that uses your play history to predict your next move in a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Built in Java. Uses Bayesian statistics.  Why Did I Build This? This project was built to showcase an AI technique that I learned from my AI course at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.
How Did I Build This? This project is built in Java and uses simple Bayesian statistics to predict the player&amp;rsquo;s next move by calculating the probability the player&amp;rsquo;s next move based on all previous moves and based on his/her previous K moves.</description>
