      <description>Yesterday, I turned 22. You could say I had a mini-quarter-life crisis. Most people retire at about age 60. That would put me at a third of the way through my career. It&amp;rsquo;s also not news that most people lay the foundations of their career in their 20s and early 30s, leading to an average peak in salary in their 40s.
 As Meg Jay, Ph.D., author of the Defining Decade says, &amp;ldquo;Eighty percent of life&amp;rsquo;s most defining moments take place by age thirty-five.</description>

      <title>A New Chapter</title>

      <description>Like many of you, I spent this past break visiting family. Every few years or so, I make the effort to visit my dad&amp;rsquo;s side of the family in southern China. The last time I visited was over three years ago. During this time, I read countless articles about China&amp;rsquo;s insane economic development, advances in artificial intelligence, and a new social credit system that looks like something that came out of a Black Mirror episode.</description>

      <title>More Information is Not Always Good</title>

      <description>A few days ago, I was debating with my co-workers Alice and Bob about whether or not having more information is always benefical to a person. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be able to express their thoughts with high fidelity, so I will only express mine here.
Having more information does not allow us to make better decisions. In fact, a lot of the time, we can benefit from having less information.</description>

      <title>Another New Site?</title>

      <description>So, it seems like every few months I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling discontent with my personal website, thus prompting me to rehaul my website over and over again. This frequent rehauling can be boiled down to two reasons.
 I have never really felt satisfied with the overall design and aesthetic of my personal website.
 I haven&amp;rsquo;t made up my mind about starting my blog back up again or not.
  I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying around with Jekyll and Bootstrap recently, and then I found Hugo.</description>

      <description>The following is a story about my dad&amp;rsquo;s iron fist and how he guided me to complete independence at a tender age of 18 and what I did about it. &amp;ldquo;When you turn 18, you&amp;rsquo;re on your own.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;When you turn 18, you&amp;rsquo;re on your own,&amp;rdquo; my dad had told me time and time again ever since I was old enough to begin worrying about college.
He told me that he would only cover my school tuition.</description>

      <title>What is your passion?</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;What is your passion?&amp;rdquo; my professor, Rui (pronounced REY) Wang, asked.
At first, the question seemed simple. Yet, after pondering it, I realized I didn&amp;rsquo;t have an answer.
&amp;ldquo;Well&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about a lot of things&amp;rdquo;, as I tried to explain. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about the environment&amp;hellip; and about other things too!&amp;rdquo;
Compared to Ray&amp;rsquo;s level of passion for his hardware business, my passion for the environment felt like peanuts. It was only an interest.</description>

      <title>My New Housemate is a Professor</title>
      <link>https://wesleytian.github.io/2016/professor/</link>

      <description>My freshmen chapter ends here and a new chapter begins.â€¨Today is my first day as housemates with my professor, Rui (pronounced REY) Wang from UMass Amherst. I will be working with him on his open-source hardware business for the next 4 months.
This opportunity is a godsend; the fact that I am making money is peanuts compared to what else I may gain from this invaluable experience. Spending so much time with an associate professor from the Computer Science department will be extremely beneficial to my development as a computer science major and as a student of academia.</description>

      <title>Are Possessions More Important Than Experiences?</title>
      <link>https://wesleytian.github.io/2016/experience/</link>

      <description>Departure. You don&amp;rsquo;t really feel the emotions of leaving a place that has been your home until about 4 days before the date of departure. Everyone talks about it long before that phase like they are sad and sentimental, but you don&amp;rsquo;t really feel it until it&amp;rsquo;s right upon you.
Starting yesterday, I&amp;rsquo;ve begun to feel it. All the emotions slowly building up, in addition to the fact that you are physically also preparing yourself, packing, and going through all of your belongings, things that you haven&amp;rsquo;t touched in years.</description>
