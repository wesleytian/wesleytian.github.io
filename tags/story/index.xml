      <title>Becoming a Better SWE</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently realized that the skills you learn as a SWE are totally disjoint from the skills that you learn in school. Below are some of my findings.
1. Nobody knows the answer. But it&amp;rsquo;s out there somewhere. It&amp;rsquo;s up to you and only you to figure it out. That&amp;rsquo;s what the company is paying you to do. Problem-solve.
When my internship first started, I rapidly shot questions at my mentor, full-timers, and other interns.</description>

      <description>So, it seems like every few months I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling discontent with my personal website, thus prompting me to rehaul my website over and over again. This frequent rehauling can be boiled down to two reasons.
 I have never really felt satisfied with the overall design and aesthetic of my personal website.
 I haven&amp;rsquo;t made up my mind about starting my blog back up again or not.
  I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying around with Jekyll and Bootstrap recently, and then I found Hugo.</description>

      <title>Hosting Hugo Using GitHub</title>

      <description>In this short tutorial, you will be creating two repositories, one that will store your Hugo source files, and one that will store the files neccessary to view your website. The website repo is called public and will be inside of your source repository. This will be done by using a git submodule.
This guide requires you to have git installed, a Hugo website that you can easily clone from it&amp;rsquo;s github repo, and a GitHub account.</description>

      <title>My Own Cryptocurrency</title>

      <description>Summary:  Cryptocurrency built in Selenium on the Ethereum blockchain. Blockchain @ Michigan Workshop. WesTCoin is currently private and the exchange rate is 1 WesTCoin ~ 1 Ethereum.  Why Did I Build This? The Blockchain @ Michigan club at the University of Michigan was hosting a workshop to teach people how to create their own cryptocurrencies on the Ethereum blockchain. As as a former blockchain and cryptocurrency enthusiast, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t turn down this great opportunity to attend this workshop.</description>

      <title>How We Won $6000 at Our First Hackathon</title>

      <description>Summary:  Won most creative use of Indico API at Hamp Hack 2017. Awarded $2000/team member in API credits. Teammates: Nischal Tamang and Phillip Michalowski.  Why Did We Build This? Usually, project ideas are either spawned from day-to-day life or assigned. However, since we decided to go to a hackathon without any preplanning, we had to come up with an idea on the spot. I think this usually works pretty well, because you don&amp;rsquo;t actually know what the prizes are and that is what usually dictates what you are building.</description>
