      <description>Here are five pieces of wisdom that I&amp;rsquo;ve gained from applying to hundreds of companies and speaking to hundreds of recruiters in the past four years. These tips aren&amp;rsquo;t just valuable for landing internship offers from the Big 4 (Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Google), but also at other companies.
1. Your Online Presence Matters More Than You Think Some people think that maintaining a personal website or LinkedIn is a waste of time.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently realized that the skills you learn as a software engineer (SWE) are disjoint from the skills that you learn in school. Below are some of my findings.
1. Nobody knows the answer, but it&amp;rsquo;s out there somewhere. It&amp;rsquo;s up to you and only you to figure it out. That&amp;rsquo;s what the company is paying you to do. Problem-solve.
When my internship first started, I shot questions at my mentor, full-timers, and other interns what seemed like every hour.</description>

      <title>Super Linux Warp Pipe</title>

      <description>Today at work I came across a problem that I managed to solve using multiple Linux pipes. What I needed to do to solve the problem was count the frequency of words existing between a certain context.
This is a simplified version of what the input looked like:
Where is the { FRUIT apple } ? Is the { PLANT tree } within the ground ? The { FRUIT banana } ate some { FRUIT banana } .</description>

      <title>My New Housemate is a Professor</title>

      <description>My freshmen chapter ends here and a new chapter begins.â€¨Today is my first day as housemates with my professor, Rui (pronounced REY) Wang from UMass Amherst. I will be working with him on his open-source hardware business for the next 4 months.
This opportunity is a godsend. The fact that I am making money is peanuts compared to what else I may gain from this invaluable experience. Spending so much time with an associate professor from the Computer Science department will be extremely beneficial to my development as a computer science major and as a student of academia.</description>
