      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve often been told that passion leads to success. It is one thing to hear a quote and another thing entirely to experience it firsthand. This summer, I was hired as an intern by Ray (Rui) Wang, a computer science professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst as well as the founder of Ray&amp;rsquo;s Hobby and OpenSprinkler. During these three months, I learned a handful of technical skills as well as professional skills such as problem solving and communication.</description>

      <description>The following is a story about my dad&amp;rsquo;s iron fist and how he guided me to complete independence at a tender age of 18 and what I did about it. &amp;ldquo;When you turn 18, you&amp;rsquo;re on your own,&amp;rdquo; my dad had told me time and time again ever since I was old enough to begin worrying about college. He had told me that he would support me financially enough only to satisfy my school tuition.</description>

      <title>I Don&#39;t Have a Passion. Yet.</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;What is your passion?&amp;rdquo; my professor, Rui (pronounced Ray) Wang, asked.
At first, the question seemed simple. Yet, after pondering it, I realized I didn&amp;rsquo;t have an answer.
&amp;ldquo;Well&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about a lot of things&amp;rdquo;, as I tried to explain. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about the environment&amp;hellip; and about other things too!&amp;rdquo;
Compared to Ray&amp;rsquo;s level of passion for his hardware business, my passion for the environment felt like peanuts. It was only an interest.</description>

      <title>Living with a Professor</title>

      <description>My freshmen chapter ends here, and a new chapter begins.â€¨Today, I moved in with an associate professor from the Computer Science department at UMass Amherst. I will be working for him for the next 4 months. He runs an open-source hardware business that produces programmable sprinklers for people. This opportunity is a godsend; the fact that I am making money is crumbs compared to what else I may gain from this invaluable experience.</description>

      <title>Experiences vs. Possessions</title>

      <description>Departure. You don&amp;rsquo;t really feel the emotions of leaving a place that has been your home until about 4 days before the date of departure. Everyone talks about it long before that phase like they are sad and sentimental, but you don&amp;rsquo;t really feel it until it&amp;rsquo;s right upon you.
Starting yesterday, I&amp;rsquo;ve begun to feel it. All the emotions slowly building up, in addition to the fact that you are physically also preparing yourself, packing, and going through all of your belongings, things that you haven&amp;rsquo;t touched in years.</description>
