      <description>Like many of you, I spent this past break visiting family. Every few years or so, I make the effort to visit my dad&amp;rsquo;s side of the family in southern China. The last time I visited was over three years ago. During this time, I read countless articles about China&amp;rsquo;s insane economic development, advances in artificial intelligence, and a new social credit system that looks like something that came out of a Black Mirror episode.</description>

      <description>A few days ago, I was debating with my co-workers Alice and Bob about whether or not having more information is always benefical to a person. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be able to express their thoughts with high fidelity, so I will only express mine here.
Having more information does not allow us to make better decisions. In fact, a lot of the time, we can benefit from having less information.</description>
