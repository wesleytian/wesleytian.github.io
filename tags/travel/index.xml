      <description>Sunrise from Refuge A 
I always like to plan things out before I do them. EspeciallyÂ with hiking mountains in a country of which language I did not know, it was especially crucial for me to plan things out before hand. I searched online and found close to nothing that would help me prepare for Mt. Olympus. I basically went to Greece with no knowledge of Mt. Olympus so I had to figure everything out on the way.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been nearly a whole year since I summited the half dome in Yosemite Valley National Park. One of my favorite hiking adventures of all time, below is the journal entry that I wrote after the hike.
Table of Contents  The Ascent The Descent Review Afterword  Half Dome, Yosemite National Park, California. Look familiar? That&amp;rsquo;s because it&amp;rsquo;s a default desktop wallpaper for Apple computers and it was the inspiration for the North Face logo.</description>
