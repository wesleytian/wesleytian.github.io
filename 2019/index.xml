      <description>But today is not the day.
You have no idea how badly I want to start a company. Maybe you do, if you know me well enough.
I&amp;rsquo;ve done just about everything. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken classes on startups, studied books such as Zero to One, worked on too many side-projects and apps, pondered potential co-founders, talked to potential co-founders, done customer research on solutions to real problems, ran large organizations, lead projects, recruited people, rejected people, sought funding, made comprehensive startup idea lists, and more.</description>

      <description>If you don&amp;rsquo;t believe in yourself, nobody else will. â€“ Me
 During my junior year of high school, when everybody else was trying the hardest that they have ever tried, I was on the verge of being put on academic probation. I ended the first semester of junior year with a 1.95 / 4.00 GPA. For those who aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with the GPA scale, 1.95 is equal to a C- (73%-70%).</description>

      <description>Serving as the President of the Michigan Data Science Team (MDST) was the best thing I did in college. It was more fulfilling than any personal project, any book I&amp;rsquo;ve read, or any internship I&amp;rsquo;ve done. It also helped me hone several invaluable soft skills that would have been hard to develop in other settings.
Why Was Being President So Fulfilling? As you will see from the examples below, the things that I did and implemented created real changes in the team.</description>

      <description>Here are five pieces of wisdom that I&amp;rsquo;ve gained from applying to hundreds of companies and speaking to hundreds of recruiters in the past four years. These tips aren&amp;rsquo;t just valuable for landing internship offers from the Big 4 (Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Google), but also at other companies.

      <description>Yesterday, I turned 22. You could say I had a mini quarter-life crisis. Most people retire at about age 60. That would put me at a third of the way through my career. It&amp;rsquo;s also not news that most people lay the foundations of their career in their 20s and early 30s, leading to an average peak in salary in their 40s.
