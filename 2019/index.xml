      <description>Yesterday, I turned 22. You could say I had a mini quarter-life crisis. Most people retire at about age 60. That would put me at a third of the way through my career. It&amp;rsquo;s also not news that most people lay the foundations of their career in their 20s and early 30s, leading to an average peak in salary in their 40s.
 As Meg Jay, Ph.D., author of the Defining Decade says, &amp;ldquo;Eighty percent of life&amp;rsquo;s most defining moments take place by age thirty-five.</description>

      <description>1. Change your graduation date Imagine it&amp;rsquo;s currently fall 2019. You were recently admitted into college last fall and expect to graduate in spring 2023. A student who has enough credits to be a junior and puts down an expected graduation date of Dec. 2018 or May 2018 instead of May 2019 will give them an enormous edge in the resume screening process. This is because companies give priority to juniors since it is easier to convert them into full-time employees.</description>
