      <title>To Improve Your Life and the World, Treat the Communities You Live In As Permanent</title>

      <description>Although I was born in Mountain View, California, I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen the bay area as my home. The longest that I&amp;rsquo;ve lived in one house was four years. As a result, I have always viewed the homes that I have lived in as nothing more than temporary housing.
Many of you reading this might find this hard to relate to, but in reality, we&amp;rsquo;re not so different. Many budding college matriculants find themselves moving to a new town for college.</description>

      <description>Mount Whitney &amp;ldquo;The Big Daddy&amp;rdquo; (14,505 ft / 4,421 m) 
Part 1: Introduction On August 6th, 2019, Douglas Qian, Newton Xie, Noriyuki Kojimano and I set out from Mountain View, CA to tackle Mount Whitney.
Not only were we determined to summit the tallest mountain in the contiguous United States, but to also do it in one day. In comparison, most overnight backpackers take between 2 and 4 days to complete.</description>

      <description>If you don&amp;rsquo;t believe in yourself, nobody else will. – Me
 During my junior year of high school, when everybody else was trying the hardest that they have ever tried, I was on the verge of being put on academic probation. I ended the first semester of junior year with a 1.95 / 4.00 GPA. For those who aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with the GPA scale, 1.95 is equal to a C- (73%-70%).</description>

      <title>Being President Was The Best Thing I Did In College</title>

      <description>Serving as the President of the Michigan Data Science Team (MDST) was the best thing I did in college. It was more fulfilling than any personal project, any book I&amp;rsquo;ve read, or any internship I&amp;rsquo;ve done. It also helped me hone several invaluable soft skills that would have been hard to develop in other settings.
Why Was Being President So Fulfilling? As you will see from the examples below, the things that I did and implemented created real changes in the team.</description>

      <description>Here are five pieces of wisdom that I&amp;rsquo;ve gained from applying to hundreds of companies and speaking to hundreds of recruiters in the past four years. These tips aren&amp;rsquo;t just valuable for landing internship offers from the Big 4 (Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Google), but also at other companies.
1. Your Online Presence Matters More Than You Think Some people think that maintaining a personal website or LinkedIn is a waste of time.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I turned 22. You could say I had a mini quarter-life crisis. Most people retire at about age 60. That would put me at a third of the way through my career. It&amp;rsquo;s also not news that most people lay the foundations of their career in their 20s and early 30s, leading to an average peak in salary in their 40s.
 As Meg Jay, Ph.D., author of the Defining Decade says, &amp;ldquo;Eighty percent of life&amp;rsquo;s most defining moments take place by age thirty-five.</description>

      <description>Doing a PhD in the US  I think doing a PhD in the US was probably questionable, compared to the UK. It has some benefits, but it took a long time. US PhDs are heavily designed for teaching — but If you’re not thinking about going into US academia, I don’t think it makes much sense.

      <description>I just finished my last class at the University of Michigan and I&amp;rsquo;d like to reflect and briefly share some of my thoughts about my experiences at UMich.
In total, I&amp;rsquo;ve been at UMich for two and a half years, starting in the fall of 2017. Living on the east side near the arboretum and the cemetary, I would commute to my classes on central by bike and my classes on north by bus.</description>

      <description>If there&amp;rsquo;s one thing that I learned from my past two years at the University of Michigan, it&amp;rsquo;s that plans change, and that&amp;rsquo;s totally okay.</description>

      <description>In April 1977, they spent Passover at the house of a student and drank a good deal of Manischewitz wine before returning to their homes at around midnight.[5] Rivest, unable to sleep, lay on the couch with a math textbook and started thinking about their one-way function. He spent the rest of the night formalizing his idea, and he had much of the paper ready by daybreak. The algorithm is now known as RSA – the initials of their surnames in same order as their paper.</description>
