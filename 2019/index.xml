      <description>1. Change your graduation date Imagine that you&amp;rsquo;re a college sophomore, but you have enough credits to graduate a year early. If you have enough credits to graduate early and you aren&amp;rsquo;t sure whether you will, it can be extremely beneficial to put the earlier graduation date that would put you at a junior standing.
Imagine it is currently the fall of 2016, you entered college in the fall 2015 and expect to graduate in spring 2019.</description>

      <description>Like many of you, I spent this past break visiting family. Every few years or so, I make the effort to visit my dad&amp;rsquo;s side of the family in southern China. The last time I visited was over three years ago. During this time, I read countless articles about China&amp;rsquo;s insane economic development, advances in artificial intelligence, and a new social credit system that looks like something that came out of a Black Mirror episode.</description>
