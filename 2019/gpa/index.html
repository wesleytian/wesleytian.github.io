<blockquote>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t believe in yourself, nobody else will. – Me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During my junior year of high school, when everybody else was trying the hardest that they have ever tried, I was on the verge of being put on academic probation. I ended my first semester of junior year with a 1.95 / 4.00 GPA. For those who aren&rsquo;t familiar with the GPA scale, 1.96 is equal to a C+ (77%-79%).</p>

<p><img src="/gpa/transcript.jpeg" alt="High school junior year transcript"
    title="I wasn't kidding." width="60%" height="60%" class="center"/>
<center> <em>My official high school transcript.</em> </center></p>

<p>I applied to college with a 2.92 GPA.</p>

<p>To put that into perspective, the average GPA for University of Michigan&rsquo;s accepted class in 2018 was 3.88 / 4.00.</p>

<p>Oh and fun fact, I also got a 1 (failing score) on the AP Computer Science exam.</p>

<p>I will split this post into two sections. Section one will be about why my GPA was so terrible. Section two will be about what I learned from this experience.</p>

<h3 id="why-was-my-gpa-so-bad">Why Was My GPA So Bad?</h3>

<p>I was first introduced to a game called League of Legends around the end of my freshman year. Soon after I started playing, I became well-known in my school as being one of the worst League of Legends players in the grade. It was a popular game at my school and people often made fun of me for how bad I was. Like being a class-clown, it was somewhat fun getting attention this way, but deep down, it didn&rsquo;t feel very nice.</p>

<p>It was around that point when I decided that I would stop at nothing to become one of the best players out there.</p>

<p>I was stuck at the bottom 10% of the players for nearly two years. I was in what they called &ldquo;Elo hell&rdquo; (Elo is the name of the player ranking system. It&rsquo;s the same ranking that chess players use.)</p>

<p><img src="/gpa/hell.png" alt=""
    title="Talk about being bad." style="width:85%;height:85%;border-radius:5px 25px" class="center"/></p>

<p>I began to spend more and more time on improving my game mechanics.</p>

<p>I had many serious fights with my parents during this time due to my falling grades. I skipped many classes and slept through my exams.</p>

<p>By the start of my junior year, I caused my parents to give up on me.</p>

<p>After two years, I reached my goal and ended up in the top 2% of players in the world. I finally became better than all my peers at League of Legends. But, my GPA suffered as a result. It wasn&rsquo;t easy. I stayed up till 4 AM on weekdays even when I had swim practice at 6 AM. I practiced my game mechanics for up to 10 continuous hours on the weekends and spent an estimated total of more than 1500 hours on the game.</p>

<p>The reason why my GPA was so bad in high school is simple. I spent all my time trying to become better than my peers at League of Legends. (And I finally did it.)</p>

<h3 id="dream-big-and-never-stop-believing-in-yourself">Dream Big and Never Stop Believing in Yourself</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always had big dreams. Everybody should. I dislike people who laugh at others for having big dreams. It&rsquo;s the one trait that I value more than everything else.</p>

<p>Like my dream of becoming the top 1% of players in League of Legends, I kept on dreaming, kept on setting goals for myself, and kept on achieving them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Those who are crazy enough to think they can change the world usually do.” – Steve Jobs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember that my biggest goal as a kid was to become a billionaire. I don&rsquo;t know why. It just seemed like a goal that was challenging.</p>

<p>That was far-fetched for me at the time so I broke that goal down into subgoals. When I was luckily accepted by University of Massachusetts, Amherst, the only thing that I had on my mind was to transfer to a better university such as Columbia or the University of Michigan. The statistics told me that going to one of these schools gave me a higher probability of becoming a billionaire.</p>

<p>From my junior year to accepting my admission to the University of Michigan in April 2017, everything I did was to help me transfer.</p>

<p>After that, my goal was to get an internship at a Big 4 tech company (Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Google), which I achieved in September 2018.</p>

<p>My next goal will be to find my dream job, wherever that is.</p>

<p>One day, I will start my own billion dollar company.</p>

<p>Note: It&rsquo;s also okay if your goals change. Unexpected things happen and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with changing your goals, as long as you don&rsquo;t change them too often. To know when a goal is worth changing, I reflect and ask myself the following question, &ldquo;is this goal taking me in the direction that makes me happy or am I doing something that others want me to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For example, between my sophomore and senior year, the only thing that I wanted to do was to pursue research in machine learning (ex. get a Ph.D. in machine learning at Stanford, then work at Google DeepMind.) I went soul-searching for quite a while, but finally realized that I was only doing it because it was the hottest thing in computer science and not because I enjoyed the work. What I really enjoyed was leading others and building communities and products. See <a href="/2019/president/">Being President Was The Best Thing I Did In College</a></p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>I hope your takeaway from this post isn&rsquo;t that I was stupid or that my parents are failures or that I like bragging about my accomplishments/goals. (I find that it&rsquo;s hard to sometimes convey the same message to everybody.)</p>

<p>The aim of my post is to convince you to dream big and never stop believing in yourself through a personal anecdote. As long as you dream big and believe in yourself, you will do what is necessary to achieve your dreams. Though this following quote is not scientifically accurate, you know what they say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot for the moon, even if you miss, you&rsquo;ll land amongst the stars.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
