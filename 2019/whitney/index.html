<p><img src="/whitney/map_route.png" alt="High school junior year transcript"
title="Road trip!" class="center_norm_rounded"/></p>

<p>On August 6th, 2019, Douglas Qian, Newton Xie, Noriyuki Kojimano and I set out from Mountain View, CA to climb Mount Whitney, the tallest mountain in the contiguous United States.</p>

<p><img src="/whitney/jeep.jpg" alt="High school junior year transcript"
title="Splendid car, egregious fuel economy" class="center_norm_rounded"/>
<center> <em>Our 2019 Jeep Wrangler rental</em> </center></p>

<p>We drove for about seven hours before arriving at Lone Pine, a quaint town at the base of Mount Whitney.</p>

<p>Along the way, we made many stops, including one near Gilroy, a city known for its garlic crop and annual Gilroy Garlic Festival.</p>

title="It tastes as expected" class="center_norm_rounded"/>
<center> <em>Gilroy&rsquo;s famous garlic ice cream</em> </center></p>

<p>After checking into our Airbnb, we quickly packed up our hiking gear and headed to the Mount Whitney trailhead (8,600 ft / 2,621 m) for some critical acclimatization.</p>

<p>Since we arrived at Lone Pine pretty late, we only hiked for a total of around two hours, before heading back and to get as much sleep as we could.</p>

<h4 id="day-2-acclimatization-at-lone-pine-lake">Day 2: Acclimatization at Lone Pine Lake</h4>

<p>Given more time the next day, we trekked to Lone Pine Lake for some more acclimatization.</p>

title="I wasn't kidding." class="center_norm_rounded"/>
<center> <em>Lone Pine Lake (10,050 ft / 3,063 m)</em> </center></p>

<p>The 5.2-mile loop to the lake and back took us a total of two hours and 45 minutes. We stayed at the lake for a couple of hours to help with the acclimatization. On the ascent, there was a thunderstorm so we were afraid that our summit day plans would be ruined. The most dangerous thing that can happen in this area, besides the effects of altitude sickness is being struck by lightning. See <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-07-16-mn-100-story.html" target="_blank">Hikers Find Death, Terror at Summit of Mt. Whitney by Los Angeles Times</a> for a horrifying tale of 13 hikers trapped at the summit during a thunderstorm.</p>

<h4 id="day-3-summit-day">Day 3: Summit Day</h4>

<p>We went to bed around 8:00 p.m. that night and being too excited to start the climb, we naturally woke up at 1:00 a.m. We got to the Mount Whitney trailhead around 2:00 a.m.
&ndash;Fix this tried to wake up at 2, naturally woke up at 1</p>

<center> <em>2:15 a.m. – Mount Whitney trailhead (8,360 ft / 2,548 m)</em> </center></p>

<p>Until about 5 a.m., we were hiking completely in the dark by using our headlamps.</p>

<p><img src="/whitney/night_crossing.jpg" alt="High school junior year transcript"
title="" class="center_norm_rounded"/>
<center> <em>Stream crossing</em> </center></p>

<p>There were a couple of streams that we had to cross, but they were quite manageable and my feet never got wet. We ate a snack about every 1.5 hours and took breaks/filtered water as needed.</p>

<p><img src="/whitney/sunrise.jpg" alt="High school junior year transcript"
title="" class="center_norm_rounded"/>
<center> <em>5:42 a.m. – Sunrise</em> </center></p>

<p>At around 5:30 a.m., we could start to see without using our headlamps. There were few people on the trail so it was incredibly serene.</p>

<p><img src="/whitney/whitney.jpg" alt="High school junior year transcript"
title="" class="center_norm_rounded"/></p>

<p>We saw a lot more people as we neared the trail camp. Many people were hiking Mount Whitney in multiple days so they were just starting to wake up and pack up their tents for the final push to the summit.</p>

<p><img src="/whitney/trail_camp.jpg" alt="High school junior year transcript"
title="" class="center_norm_rounded"/>
<center> <em>5:58 a.m. – Trail Camp (12,039 ft, 3,669 m)</em> </center></p>

<p>This was the last place to get water according to both online and local sources. According to an online source, we only needed 1.5L to 2L of water, which we only realized didn&rsquo;t make sense after it was too late. I drank 2L of water to get to trail camp and the route to trail camp was only a quarter of the entire trail. From trail camp to summit and back to trail camp was around half of the entire trail, so at the very least we should have brought 4L of water.</p>

<p>This also marked the beginning of the infamous &ldquo;97-switchbacks&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img src="/whitney/switchbacks.jpg" alt="Switchbacks"

<center> <em>Some of the switchbacks</em> </center></p>

<center> <em>8:45 a.m – Trail Crest (13,645 ft / 4,159 m) (Facing west)</em> </center></p>

<p>As we neared the summit, Doug ran out of water. Without water at such an altitude was a recipe for disaster. Since we carried water filters with us, I suggested that the next person who had to piss should piss into my water filter instead.</p>

<p>Newton was the next to piss so he pissed into my filter. Doug refused to drink water that had been filtered from piss, so Newton offered the remaining of his water to Doug and decided to drink the filtered piss himself. According to Netwon, the filtered urine was slightly bitter but otherwise tasted fine.</p>

<p><img src="/whitney/towards_summit.jpg" alt="Summit"

<center> <em>9:37 a.m. – Mount Whitney (Facing east)</em> </center></p>

<p>It was around this point that mountain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_sickness" target="_blank">altitude sickness</a> began to chip away at our body. Even with the two previous days of acclimatization, Nori&rsquo;s heartrate remained a steady 180 BPM while running out of breath consistently, Newton felt nauseous and wanted to puke, and we all had the worst headaches of our entire lives. Every time we moved, we could feel our heads throbbing and pulsating with blood.</p>

title="From left to right: Nori, Doug, me, and Newton" class="center_norm_rounded"/>
<center> <em>10:22 a.m. – The snowfield before the summit</em> </center></p>

<p>There was no way that we would come this far just to turn back now. Giving up was not an option. Confronting the altitude sickness, harsh winds, and the near-zero temperatures, we trudged onwards and eventually made it to the summit.</p>

<p><img src="/whitney/summit_group.jpg" alt="High school junior year transcript"
title="From left to right: Nori, Doug, me, and Newton" class="center_norm_rounded"/>
<center> <em>11:09 a.m. – Mount Whitney summit (14,505 ft / 4,421 m)</em> </center></p>

<p>To celebrate, Doug and I had some Tangerine Express IPA. Drinking beers at the summit might not have been the smartest idea as it slows down acclimatization and dehydrates you, but YOLO. We hung out for some lunch, drinks, and pictures before quickly descending to alleviate the symptoms of altitude sickness. Thankfully, we found a few sources of water that we could filter on the way down that prevented us from dangerous dehydration.</p>

<p><img src="/whitney/beer.jpg" alt="Having a drink at the summit"
title="" class="center_norm_rounded"/>
<center> <em>Enjoying a well-deserved drink</em> </center></p>

<p>On the way down, some hikers told us about the best burger ever at the Whitney Portal Store. Since the store closed at 7:30 p.m., we had to make it back by then. Doug injured his knee so Netwon stayed with him while Nori an I ran down the mountain to order burgers for all of us. We made it down in record time.</p>

<center> <em>The best burger ever</em> </center></p>

<h4 id="overall-was-it-worth-it">Overall, was it worth it?</h4>

<p>Definitely.</p>

<p>This hike may be the hardest non-technical day-hike in the contiguous US. At the very least, it&rsquo;s the tallest. The hike wasn&rsquo;t technical at all. I remember only having to use my hands twice, when there were icy rocks on the switchbacks and when I slipped coming down on the snowfield.</p>

<p>Though it was a long hike, anyone who is somewhat athletic and has good cardiovascular health should be able to conquer this mountain. Training will vary from person to person. A few months before this, I trained for a marathon at a 3:30 to 4:00 pace and I did a 10+ mile trek in Washington state. I also did some targeted work on my calves, side glutes, and hip flexors because of some muscle imbalances. Besides having also trained for and ran a marathon a few months prior, Doug didn&rsquo;t do any additional training for the hike and was also fine. None of us felt anything besides some slight soreness the next day.</p>

<p>The hardest part of the hike was the symptoms of altitude sickness. Without Advil, the headaches made the summit very painful.</p>

<h4 id="what-s-next">What&rsquo;s next?</h4>

<p>There are two routes I can take. I can either stick with non-technical hikes and start doing multi-day hikes, or I can start doing technical hikes.</p>

<p>More challenging non-technical hikes include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kilimanjaro" target="_blank">Mount Kilimanjaro</a> (19,341 ft / 5,895 m) in Tanzania, Africa or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aconcagua" target="_blank">Mount Aconcagua</a> (22,837 ft / 6,960 m) in Argentina, South America. Both of these are part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Summits" target="_blank">Seven Summits</a>, which are now on my radar.</p>

<p>Or, I could start learning technical mountaineering skills such as self-arrest with an ice pick and begin to do technical climbs such as on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rainier" target="_blank">Mount Rainier</a> (14,111 ft / 4,392 m).</p>

<p>Whatever I choose, this hike has done a poor job at deterring me from more challenging hikes and only has me craving more.</p>

<p>&#42;My recommendations are in parentheses. <br>
&#42;&#42;The amount of water you bring depends on the mountain water conditions and the time of year. Check with the park ranger or with recent hikers through <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/30962451768/about/" target="_blank">AllTrails</a> or the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/30962451768/about/" target="_blank">Mt. Whitney Facebook Group</a> to see how much water you should be bringing. <br></p>

<p>&#42;&#42;&#42; Bring and drink at your own risk. <br>
&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;You will be given one of these for each person in your group when you pick up your permit.</p>

<p>If you have any additional questions or need any tips about the hike, feel free to reach out!</p>

<p>Lastly, do your research and take everything with a grain of salt. Experiences are all very subjective. If you want to summit Mount Whitney, start preparing before April of that year since the permit lottery happens during that time.</p>
