      <description>1. Take classes with the course chair Taking classes with the course chair for courses with many sections such as Linear Algebra guarantees you a proficient teacher. They will most likely provide extra perks such as review sessions and review sheets. You are also guaranteed that the instructor will cover everything on the tests so you won&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about your professor omitting something.
I took Calculus I with the course chair during my freshman year.</description>

      <title>Hacking an Inadequate Air Conditioner – Part 1</title>

      <description>It was scorching hot this summer in Amherst, Massachusetts. Especially because my room was on the second floor, the room temperature would often rise to over 100° F during midday. The house I stayed in didn&amp;rsquo;t have a central HVAC (heat-ventilation-air-conditioning) system built into the house so we opted for a window AC that could be inserted into the frame of the window and be plugged into the wall outlet for power.</description>

      <description>Sunrise from Refuge A 
I always like to plan things out before I do them. Especially with hiking mountains in a country of which language I did not know, it was especially crucial for me to plan things out before hand. I searched online and found close to nothing that would help me prepare for Mt. Olympus. I basically went to Greece with no knowledge of Mt. Olympus so I had to figure everything out on the way.</description>

      <title>Building My Own Headphone Amp</title>

      <description>The finished Objective2 headphone amp
As a music enthusiast, I&amp;rsquo;ve always been in the pursuit of the best sound replication devices. As I researched more and more about headphones and the amazing world of sound replication, I kept reading about these things called amps and DACs (digital-to-analag converters). For a long time, I simply ignored those terms as I felt that they were too advanced for the average Joe. They seemed too complicated and only for the professional studio recorders or niche audiophile market.</description>

      <title>The Most Important Thing That I Learned This Summer</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve often been told that passion leads to success. It is one thing to hear a quote and another thing entirely to experience it firsthand. This summer, I was hired as an intern by Rui (pronounced REY) Wang, a computer science professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst as well as the founder of Ray&amp;rsquo;s Hobby and OpenSprinkler. During these three months, I learned a handful of technical skills as well as professional skills such as problem solving and communication.</description>

      <title>How I Became Independent at 18</title>

      <description>The following is a story about my dad&amp;rsquo;s iron fist and how he guided me to complete independence at a tender age of 18 and what I did about it. &amp;ldquo;When you turn 18, you&amp;rsquo;re on your own.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;When you turn 18, you&amp;rsquo;re on your own,&amp;rdquo; my dad had told me time and time again ever since I was old enough to begin worrying about college.
He told me that he would only cover my school tuition.</description>

      <title>I Don&#39;t Have a Passion</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;What is your passion?&amp;rdquo; my professor, Rui (pronounced REY) Wang, asked.
At first, the question seemed simple. Yet, after pondering it, I realized I didn&amp;rsquo;t have an answer.
&amp;ldquo;Well&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about a lot of things&amp;rdquo;, I tried to explain. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about the environment and&amp;hellip; about other things too!&amp;rdquo;
Compared to Rui&amp;rsquo;s level of passion for his hardware business, my passion for the environment felt like peanuts. It was only an interest.</description>

      <title>My New Housemate is a Professor</title>
      <link>https://wesleytian.github.io/2016/professor/</link>

      <description>My freshmen chapter ends here and a new chapter begins. Today is my first day as housemates with my professor, Rui (pronounced REY) Wang from UMass Amherst. I will be working with him on his open-source hardware business for the next 4 months.
This opportunity is a godsend. The fact that I am making money is peanuts compared to what else I may gain from this invaluable experience. Spending so much time with an associate professor from the Computer Science department will be extremely beneficial to my development as a computer science major and as a student of academia.</description>

      <title>Thanks Amigos</title>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all heard this quote before:
 “You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.” – Jim Rohn
 Do your friends define who you are? Take a moment to ponder this thought.
Initially, the answer is no. You are yourself and there is nobody who can learn who you are by being around your friends. We are each too unique to be defined that way.</description>

      <title>Material Possessions vs. Experiences</title>

      <description>Departure. You don&amp;rsquo;t really feel the emotions of leaving a place that has been your home until about 4 days before the date of departure. Everyone talks about it long before that phase like they are sad and sentimental, but you don&amp;rsquo;t really feel it until it&amp;rsquo;s right upon you.
Starting yesterday, I&amp;rsquo;ve begun to feel it. All the emotions slowly building up, in addition to the fact that you are physically also preparing yourself, packing, and going through all of your belongings, things that you haven&amp;rsquo;t touched in years.</description>
