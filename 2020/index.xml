      <description>On February 15th, 2020, I predicted that COVID-19, which was wrecking havoc in China at the time would soon spread to the United States and wreak havoc here.
On February 15th, 2020, I sold 85% percent of all my stocks.On February 18th, 2020, the S&amp;amp;P reached an all time high, despite the known ___ in China.
On February 25th, 2020, the S&amp;amp;P crashed.
Today is March 14th, 2020 and I am making a few more predictions about the future.</description>
