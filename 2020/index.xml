      <description>Last summer, in my most popular and inspirational blog post yet, I wrote about how believing in myself, dreaming big, and following my plans to a tee led me from nearly failing high school to landing offers at Big Tech (Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple).

      <description>Besides being a 1-hour drive to this beautiful beach, that is. 
Preface Though COVID-19 has been an inconvenience for many, it has allowed more and more people the autonomy to choose where they want to live. Seeing that my work could be done remotely for the foreseeable future and that my girlfriend, Carol, was willing to relocate with me since all of her classes would be remote, why not choose somewhere I want to live?</description>

      <description>On February 15th, 2020, I predicted that COVID-19, which was wrecking havoc in China at the time would soon spread to the United States and wreak havoc here.
On February 15th, 2020, I sold 85% percent of all my stocks.
On February 18th, 2020, the S&amp;amp;P 500 reached an all time high, despite the known deaths in China.
On February 21th, 2020, the S&amp;amp;P 500 crashed.
Today is March 14th, 2020 and I am making a few more predictions about the future.</description>

      <description>Although I was born in Mountain View, California, I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen the bay area as my home. The longest that I&amp;rsquo;ve lived in one house was four years. As a result, I have always viewed the homes that I have lived in as nothing more than temporary housing.
Many of you reading this might find this hard to relate to, but in reality, we&amp;rsquo;re not so different. Many budding college matriculants find themselves moving to a new town for college.</description>
