Preface Though COVID-19 has been an inconvenience for many, it has allowed more and more people the autonomy to choose where they want to live. Seeing that my work could be done remotely for the foreseeable future and that my girlfriend, Carol, was willing to relocate with me since all of her classes would be remote, why not choose somewhere I want to live?

        Although I was born in Mountain View, California, I&rsquo;ve never seen the bay area as my home. The longest that I&rsquo;ve lived in one house was four years. As a result, I have always viewed the homes that I have lived in as nothing more than temporary housing.
Many of you reading this might find this hard to relate to, but in reality, we&rsquo;re not so different. Many budding college matriculants find themselves moving to a new town for college.

 During my junior year of high school, when everybody else was trying the hardest that they have ever tried, I was on the verge of being put on academic probation. I ended the first semester of junior year with a 1.95 / 4.00 GPA. For those who aren&rsquo;t familiar with the GPA scale, 1.95 is equal to a C- (73%-70%).

It was more fulfilling than any personal project, any book I&rsquo;ve read, or any internship I&rsquo;ve done.

Why Was Being President So Fulfilling? As you will see from the examples below, the things that I did and implemented created real changes in the team.

        Here are five pieces of wisdom that I&rsquo;ve gained from applying to hundreds of companies and speaking to hundreds of recruiters in the past four years. These tips aren&rsquo;t just valuable for landing internship offers from the Big 4 (Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Google), but also at other companies.
1. Your Online Presence Matters More Than You Think Some people think that maintaining a personal website or LinkedIn is a waste of time.

        Yesterday, I turned 22. You could say I had a mini quarter-life crisis. Most people retire at about age 60. That would put me at a third of the way through my career. It&rsquo;s also not news that most people lay the foundations of their career in their 20s and early 30s, leading to an average peak in salary in their 40s.
 As Meg Jay, Ph.D., author of the Defining Decade says, &ldquo;Eighty percent of life&rsquo;s most defining moments take place by age thirty-five.

Having more information does not allow us to make better decisions. In fact, a lot of the time, we can benefit from having less information.

1. Nobody knows the answer, but it&rsquo;s out there somewhere. It&rsquo;s up to you and only you to figure it out. That&rsquo;s what the company is paying you to do. Problem-solve.
When my internship first started, I shot questions at my mentor, full-timers, and other interns what seemed like every hour.

 I have never really felt satisfied with the overall design and aesthetic of my personal website.
 I haven&rsquo;t made up my mind about starting my blog back up again or not.
  I&rsquo;ve been toying around with Jekyll and Bootstrap recently, and then I found Hugo.

        1. Take classes with the course chair Taking classes with the course chair for courses with many sections such as Linear Algebra guarantees you a proficient teacher. They will most likely provide extra perks such as review sessions and review sheets. You are also guaranteed that the instructor will cover everything on the tests so you won&rsquo;t have to worry about your professor omitting something.
I took Calculus I with the course chair during my freshman year.

It was scorching hot this summer in Amherst, Massachusetts. Especially because my room was on the second floor, the room temperature would often rise to over 100Â° F during midday. The house I stayed in didn&rsquo;t have a central HVAC (heat-ventilation-air-conditioning) system built into the house so we opted for a window AC that could be inserted into the frame of the window and be plugged into the wall outlet for power.

        The finished Objective2 headphone amp
As a music enthusiast, I&rsquo;ve always been in the pursuit of the best sound replication devices. As I researched more and more about headphones and the amazing world of sound replication, I kept reading about these things called amps and DACs (digital-to-analag converters). For a long time, I simply ignored those terms as I felt that they were too advanced for the average Joe. They seemed too complicated and only for the professional studio recorders or niche audiophile market.

      <div class="content">
        I&rsquo;ve often been told that passion leads to success. It is one thing to hear a quote and another thing entirely to experience it firsthand. This summer, I was hired as an intern by Rui (pronounced REY) Wang, a computer science professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst as well as the founder of Ray&rsquo;s Hobby and OpenSprinkler. During these three months, I learned a handful of technical skills as well as professional skills such as problem solving and communication.

      <div class="content">
        The following is a story about my dad&rsquo;s iron fist and how he guided me to complete independence at a tender age of 18 and what I did about it. &ldquo;When you turn 18, you&rsquo;re on your own.&rdquo; &ldquo;When you turn 18, you&rsquo;re on your own,&rdquo; my dad had told me time and time again ever since I was old enough to begin worrying about college.
He told me that he would only cover my school tuition.
