      <description>So, it seems like every few months I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling discontent with my personal website, thus prompting me to rehaul my website over and over again. This frequent rehauling can be boiled down to two reasons.
 I have never really felt satisfied with the overall design and aesthetic of my personal website.
 I haven&amp;rsquo;t made up my mind about starting my blog back up again or not.
  I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying around with Jekyll and Bootstrap recently, and then I found Hugo.</description>

      <description>In this short tutorial, you will be creating two repositories, one that will store your Hugo source files, and one that will store the files neccessary to view your website. The website repo is called public and will be inside of your source repository. This will be done by using a git submodule.
This guide requires you to have git installed, a Hugo website that you can easily clone from it&amp;rsquo;s github repo, and a GitHub account.</description>

      <description>Wesley has a couple official roles, but in reality, those are just labels. Deep inside, he just wants to be happy and free, but he is under society&amp;rsquo;s spell to do well and get a good career. His goal is to break that spell eventually and truly disregard his own meta-judgment as well as others to live a fulfilling life that will benefit mankind.
Wesley lives by a few philosophies.</description>
