&lt;p&gt;Hi there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my personal blog!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created this website because I enjoy writing and want to get better at it. I also want to share what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from my life experiences with other people, just as others have shared with me (e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;www.pgbovine.net&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Phillip Guo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;blog.samaltman.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sam Altman&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;paulgraham.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Paul Graham&lt;/a&gt;). This blog is intended cover a smorgasbord of topics â€“ from hardware projects to philosophical musings. When reading my posts, keep in mind that I love engagement! I would love to hear any thoughts you may have regarding my posts. I will respond as quickly as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-me&#34;&gt;About Me&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wesleytian.github.io/me2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Wesley Tian&#34; style=&#34;width:20%;height:20%;border-radius:5px 25px&#34; class=&#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently recieved my Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Michigan. While there, I studied computer science, data science, and entrepreneurship. I also served as the president of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.engin.umich.edu/2018/08/michigan-data-science-team-wrangles-big-data/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Michigan Data Science Team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before attending the University of Michigan, I took computer science, mathematics, and economics classes at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have interned as a software engineer at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington, &lt;a href=&#34;https://clinc.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Clinc AI&lt;/a&gt; in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Fidelity Investments in Merrimack, New Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I was born in Mountain View, California and lived in Milpitas, California for the first 5.5 years of my life, I am blessed to have been able to call many places my home. I have also lived in West Linn, Oregon (2.5 years), Taipei, Taiwan (1.5 years), Shanghai, China (2.5 years in the Lujiazui Subdistrict and 6 years in the Huamu Subdistrict), Amherst, Massachusetts (2 years), and Ann Arbor, Michigan (2.5 years). I currently live in Ann Arbor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hobbies include writing, reading, mountain climbing (on hold), running, powerlifting (on hold), playing the violin, and learning Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--
Both my parents are naturalized Americans citizens of Chinese descent. My dad, Jason, was the VP of [Nikon Precisions China](https://www.nikon.com/products/semi/) and is currently the COO of [Piotech](http://en.sypiotech.cn/), a late-stage nano-scale semiconductor equipment startup in Shenyang, China. He holds a B.S. in electrical engineering from South China University of Technology, a M.S. in electrical engineering from Northeastern University and an M.B.A. from Nanyang Technological University. Fun fact, he was part of the [class of &#39;77](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/world/asia/06china.html), the most competitive class in modern Chinese history. My mom, Robin, also studied electrical engineering during her undergrad and also graduated from the Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. She is retired. My older half-sister, Jeni, who grew up in Boston, Massachussetts, is the COO of [Legacy Brands International](https://lacannabisnews.com/chuuuch-cannabis-product-line-with-bishop-don-magic-juan-announced-as-the-latest-addition-to-legacy-brands-internationals-portfolio/) and was previously a co-founder and the Chief Marketing Officer of [Frilly](https://ktla.com/2017/11/29/customize-your-fashion-with-frilly-com/). She is currently attending culinary school in Paris, France. --&gt;
