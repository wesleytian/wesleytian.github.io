      <title>A New Chapter</title>

      <content>&lt;p&gt;Like many of you, I spent this past break visiting family. Every few years or so, I make the effort to visit my dad&amp;rsquo;s side of the family in southern China. The last time I visited was over three years ago. During this time, I read countless articles about China&amp;rsquo;s insane economic development, advances in artificial intelligence, and new social credit system that looks like something that came out of a Black Mirror episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So naturally, when I went back, I was expecting to see a drastically changed China. I also knew that China had passed policies to reduce the negative consequences that their development was incurring on the environment. I saw from my friends&amp;rsquo; Instagram stories that the skies in Shanghai were blue. I was excited to not have to wear masks to filter out the pollutants in the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, what I saw in southern China left me horrified and disgusted. I realized that all of this economic development was not making China a better place to live, even in the face of all of the accomplishments that they made in recent years. Though Forbes predicts that China&amp;rsquo;s GDP will surpass that of the US before 2030, I fear not only for the health and happiness of Chinese people but everybody that shares Earth’s ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wesleytian.github.io/jiangxi.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Jiangxi, China&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I looked out of the window that afternoon and saw the ruined state that the city was in I felt a surge of anger well up inside me. I wasn’t just mad at the Chinese government’s selfish policies in an effort to become number one again but at all capitalist nations. I then took out my laptop and began to write a new chapter in my book and my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One problem that I&amp;rsquo;m discussing in my book is the problem of focusing on mindless growth and competition. Countries such as the United States and China have focused on growth and selfish economic gain for too long. Did you know that the average life expectancy of US citizen has actually decreased in the past two years due to suicide? If that doesn&amp;rsquo;t express the dissatisfaction of individual lives, I don&amp;rsquo;t know what does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a species that has dominated the world for at least the past 100,000 years, it is easy for us to think that we are &amp;ldquo;special&amp;rdquo; and that God has our back. However, by thinking this way, we inevitably doom ourselves by thinking that no matter what we do, we will be okay. The more we think this way, the more overconfident we grow in our own abilities and the more we forget that certain damages can be irreversible. We can recover the polluted air, but we can’t recover people’s past suffering. We can’t recover lost lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is time that we choose a new development index that doesn&amp;rsquo;t solely focus on GDP, but rather, on the happiness and well-being of all living species. Not just for China and the United States, but for all nations. In the meantime, I now find purpose in pursuing public policy as well as disproving Adam Smith.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>More Information is Not Always Good</title>
      <link>https://wesleytian.github.io/2018/information/</link>

      <description></description>
      
      <content>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I was debating with my co-workers Ty and Anish about whether or not having more information is helpful for making better decisions. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be able to express their thoughts with high fidelity, so I will only express mine here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having more information does not allow us to make better decisions. In fact, a lot of the time, we can benefit from having less information. A few examples that we discussed included the infamous story of George Dantzig (shown in the intro of Good Will Hunting), who walked into class late one day believing that the two questions he saw on the board were homework questions. Only later did he discover that the two questions he solved for homework were famous unsolved statistics questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If he hadn&amp;rsquo;t walked into the classroom late that day and heard that it was a famous unsolved question, he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have even attempted solving the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example that came up just the other day was at my workplace. I had been working on updating TensorFlow from 1.0 to 1.8 and my mentor told me that I would need to overhaul an LSTM model before the upgrade could be completed because of incompatible dependencies. Because of my mentor&amp;rsquo;s authority and perceived knowledge, I didn&amp;rsquo;t give what he said any second thought and just accepted it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Anish wasn&amp;rsquo;t told this and because he wanted to use some features of 1.8 pretty badly, he tried to upgrade it to 1.8 anyways. In this way, without the information given to him from a position in higher power first, he never gave a second thought about trying to upgrade it himself. Lo and behold, we didn&amp;rsquo;t actually need to touch the LSTM model before the upgrade and the request was merged late last night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, statistics such as how unlikely it is for you to start a company and bring it to IPO only prevent people from succeeding. The best way to go about this is to have an optimistic you-can-do-it attitude and try your best to ignore the pessimistic facts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Becoming Better at Software Engineering</title>

      <content>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently realized that the skills you learn as a SWE are totally disjoint from the skills that you learn in school. Below are some of my findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.
Nobody knows the answer, but it&amp;rsquo;s out there somewhere. It&amp;rsquo;s up to you and only you to figure it out. That&amp;rsquo;s what the company is paying you to do. Problem-solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my internship first started, I rapidly shot questions at my mentor, full-timers, and other interns. After a while, I realized that they didn&amp;rsquo;t know the answers to my questions either. Either we would figure it out on the spot together or they would try to give me the most guidance they could (usually not much). Then the rest was left up to me to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In school, we have a completely reversed dichotomy where you are able to ask your professor virtually anything about the class and get a fairly accurate answer. But in the workplace, there&amp;rsquo;s no such thing. This is because when you work, you are doing active research. You aren&amp;rsquo;t just taking in facts and spitting them back out again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.
Take it slow. Learning takes time, debugging takes time, and detours are normal. It&amp;rsquo;s a primary SWE skill to be able to determine how long the detour should be. As interns, we tend to try and decrease this detour as much as possible to get as much done as possible, but as I&amp;rsquo;ve recently learned, that isn&amp;rsquo;t the most optimal plan. Instead, you should try to increase your time on detours to provide a more solid foundation for later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I mean by a detour is the path in which you take to solve a problem such as an error or bug. It usually requires a lot of googling, time on Stack Overflow, reading through documentation, amongst other things. I think that if you spend more time actually learning why something works instead of just copying and pasting code, you will make seemingly slower progress at first, but soon realize that you&amp;rsquo;ve actually been creating a better foundation for yourself that will benefit you in the long-run. It&amp;rsquo;s more or less about investing your time in the right place now for long-term benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, instead of just copying a Linux command from some website and running it, I now take apart each command and flag and learn what each one does. This means that in the future, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to use those commands in my own way instead of having to search online again and again for the similar commands/flags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit (08-02-2018):&lt;br /&gt;
In fact, investing in peer-driven learning environments can make your long-term work more effective, despite short-term costs in time. – Vincent Chen, computer science student at Stanford University.   &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.ycombinator.com/learning-math-for-machine-learning/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://blog.ycombinator.com/learning-math-for-machine-learning/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Super Linux Warp Pipe</title>
      <link>https://wesleytian.github.io/2018/pipe/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Jul 2018 00:14:49 -0400</pubDate>

      <description></description>
      
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Today at work I came across a problem that I managed to solve using multiple Linux pipes. What I needed to do to solve the problem was count the frequency of words existing between a certain context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a simplified version of what the input looked like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Where is the { FRUIT apple } ?
Is the { PLANT tree } within the ground ?
The { FRUIT banana } ate some { FRUIT banana } .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I wanted to look for the frequency of words only with the &lt;code&gt;FRUIT&lt;/code&gt; label, then the intended output should look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;2 banana
1 apple
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent a breach of confidentiality, I have replaced the actual words with something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The command that ended up doing the trick was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cat input_file | grep -o -P &#39;(?&amp;lt;={ FRUIT).*?(?= })&#39; | grep -v &amp;quot;^\s$&amp;quot; | sort | uniq -c | sort -bnr &amp;gt; output_file
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below, I will break down what each part does. I will cover the following commands and flags: &lt;code&gt;grep -o -P -v&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sort -bnr&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;uniq -c&lt;/code&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ll cover regular expressions (regex) in another post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;grep -o&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;grep --only-matching&lt;/code&gt; basically matches and prints out only the matched phrase. For example, since I wanted to count the number of occurrences of each of these words or phrases, I wanted to not only search for the words between &lt;code&gt;{ FRUIT&lt;/code&gt;  and &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;, but print them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;grep -P&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;grep --perl-regexp&lt;/code&gt; is pretty self-explanatory. It allows you to specify a Perl regex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;grep -v&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;grep --inverse-match&lt;/code&gt; selects lines that don&amp;rsquo;t match the regex. It&amp;rsquo;s the negation of standard grep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;uniq -c&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;uniq --count&lt;/code&gt; prefixes each line with the number of occurrences of each phrase or word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sort -b&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;sort --ignore-leading-blanks&lt;/code&gt; ignores leading blanks. Surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sort -n&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;sort --numeric-sort&lt;/code&gt; sorts in ascending numerical order. (0, 1, 2, &amp;hellip; 9)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sort -r&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;sort --reverse&lt;/code&gt; reverses the sort.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Another New Site?</title>
      <link>https://wesleytian.github.io/2018/another-new-site/</link>

      <description></description>
      
      <content>&lt;p&gt;So, it seems like every few months I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling discontent with my personal website, thus prompting me to rehaul my website over and over again. This frequent rehauling can be boiled down to two reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have never really felt satisfied with the overall design and aesthetic of my personal website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t made up my mind about starting my blog back up again or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying around with Jekyll and Bootstrap recently, and then I found Hugo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugo is a static site generator that uses Go for templating which means that you can easily separate your content and the code that builds the site. It&amp;rsquo;s completely open-source and was actually based on Jekyll. Many other people agree with me on the awesomeness of Hugo: &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16472395&amp;amp;ref=codebldr&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16472395&amp;amp;ref=codebldr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever wanted to create your own site that&amp;rsquo;s easy to maintain and free to host, check out my next post for a great tutorial that&amp;rsquo;s written for the average person in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: Since creating this website, I&amp;rsquo;m really enjoying writing again. I think the medium in which you post on is really important. For me, at least.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hosting Hugo Using GitHub</title>
      <link>https://wesleytian.github.io/2018/a-better-hugo-tutorial/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 15 Jul 2018 00:14:49 -0400</pubDate>

      <description></description>
      
      <content>&lt;p&gt;In this short tutorial, you will be creating two repositories, one that will store your Hugo source files, and one that will store the files neccessary to view your website. The website repo is called &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; and will be inside of your source repository. This will be done by using a &lt;code&gt;git submodule&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide requires you to have git installed, a Hugo website that you can easily clone from it&amp;rsquo;s github repo, and a GitHub account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a GitHub repository for your website. Name it &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;USERNAME&amp;gt;.github.io&lt;/code&gt;. All your files neccessary for your website will be stored here.&lt;br /&gt;
Ex: wesleytian.github.io&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a Github repository for all of your Hugo source code. Name it anything you like &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;USERNAME&amp;gt;.github.io&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Ex: blog&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navigate to a directory where you want your source files to be stored. &lt;code&gt;cd &amp;lt;DIRECTORY&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;git clone &amp;lt;SOURCE_REPO_URL&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ex: &lt;code&gt;cd webdev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/wesleytian/blog.git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change directory to the repository you just cloned. &lt;code&gt;cd &amp;lt;SOURCE&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ex: &lt;code&gt;cd blog&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git submodule add -b master &amp;lt;WEBSITE_REPO_URL&amp;gt; public&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ex: &lt;code&gt;git submodule add -b master https://github.com/wesleytian/wesleytian.github.io.git public&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copy all of your Hugo source files into the source folder except the public folder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a script based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#put-it-into-a-script&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#put-it-into-a-script&lt;/a&gt;
and run &lt;code&gt;./deploy.sh &amp;quot;Optional commit message&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;. Do both of these steps in your source folder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are now done! You should now be able to access your website through &lt;a href=&#34;https://USERNAME.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://USERNAME.github.io/&lt;/a&gt; It make take a few minutes for your DNS to refresh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that your website is now up to date in the &lt;USERNAME&gt;.github.io repo, but your source files have not yet been added, committed, and pushed to GitHub. To do so, simply type &lt;code&gt;git add . &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git commit -m &amp;quot;commit message&amp;quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git push origin master&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: This guide is based off of &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#step-by-step-instructions&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#step-by-step-instructions&lt;/a&gt;
but is more detailed, and includes steps that were missing from the original documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: You also have to clone a theme into the themes/ folder or else you will get a &amp;ldquo;missing layouts&amp;rdquo; error.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>College Advice from an Computer Science Freshman with a 4.00 GPA</title>
      <link>https://wesleytian.github.io/2016/advice/</link>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-take-classes-with-the-course-chair&#34;&gt;1. Take classes with the course chair&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking classes with the course chair for courses with multiple sections such as Linear Algebra guarantees you a proficient teacher.  They will most likely provide extra perks such as review sessions and review sheets. You are also guaranteed that the instructor will cover everything on the tests so you won&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about your professor omitting something.
I took Calculus I with the course chair my freshman year. On the first day of class, he shared with the class a special link that included all the practice exams and their solutions since the creation of the course. Additionally, he told us that the link was exclusive to our class and insisted that we didn&amp;rsquo;t share the login info with other sections of the course. I suppose that it may be related to keeping his position as the course chair but I that&amp;rsquo;s just speculation.
Even if the course chair&amp;rsquo;s section is full, you can always e-mail him or talk to him personally to grab a seat. Remember to be polite as he isn&amp;rsquo;t required by any means to fulfill your request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-always-sit-at-the-front-of-the-class&#34;&gt;2. Always sit at the front of the class&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting at the front of the class makes you less afraid to shout out answers and ask questions.
You are more likely to be heard by the instructor and get your question answered. The instructor will notice you more and if you provide a continuous stream of answers and engaging questions, then you are sure to obtain a special seat in the eyes of the instructor. e.g. they will be more likely to help you out when you need help for exams or when asking about research opportunities.
You will be less likely to be distracted by your friends and what other people are doing because there is nothing in front of you so you are more likely to pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-don-t-pick-general-education-courses-just-for-the-easy-a&#34;&gt;3. Don&amp;rsquo;t pick General Education courses just for the easy A&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about what you can learn from it, what the department&amp;rsquo;s reputation at your university is, the background of the instructor teaching it and then lastly consider its difficulty.
Fulfilling your general education requirements by taking the easiest classes at your university wastes both your money (or your parents!) and your time. Don&amp;rsquo;t select courses solely because you heard they are easy! However, you may benefit if you can find a course that benefits you in the long-run or just plainly interests you AND it&amp;rsquo;s easy, then that&amp;rsquo;s fine. Just don&amp;rsquo;t prioritize the difficulty of the class over everything else. What I mean about benefiting you in the long-run are courses such as taking Game Theory (ECON 309) as a Computer Science major. Though it may seem irrelevant, it is applicable in AI, business, mathematics, psychology and other fields. Not only did Game Theory interest me, but it may actually benefit me in the long-run!
Additionally, you should do research about the instructor and department of the general education classes you want to take. At the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the Computer Science department is well known for its research and faculty especially in AI, but what UMass Amherst truly excels at is it&amp;rsquo;s Linguistics department in the College of Humanities and Fine Arts. They are ranked 4-8 at PhDs.org - UMass in the United States and so fulfilling a general education requirement by taking a linguistics intro course is sure to be interesting and taught extremely well. Where else can you learn from the smartest professors in their field?
Take a look at PhDs.org for the departments that university excel at, it could be a well-known one or a less known one. Most undergraduates don&amp;rsquo;t ever talk about the research and faculty quality of such departments, but if you talk to graduate students or professors they will know for sure.
Obviously, use your common sense as well. UMass Amherst is ranked 1-2 out of 32 programs for food science, 1-&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;41&lt;/sub&gt; programs for Kinesiology, 3-&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;83&lt;/sub&gt; for Polymer Science and Engineering, but if you&amp;rsquo;re not interested in food science, kinesiology, or polymer science, then don&amp;rsquo;t take it! Just remember to take it into consideration. You will never know what great professors you will meet and things you will learn from just fulfilling a general education requirement.
More to be added soon!&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>&lt;p&gt;Wesley Tian is currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and Data Science at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://umich.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt;. He currently serves as the President of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mdst.club/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Michigan Data Science Team&lt;/a&gt;, a competitive data science team funded by Google, the National Science Foundation, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://midas.umich.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Michigan Institute of Data Science&lt;/a&gt;. Their work for social good has been covered by media outlets such as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/us/flint-water-lead-pipes.html?_r=0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gizmodo.com/google-is-helping-flint-prioritize-which-lead-pipes-nee-1774517926&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/midwest/ct-flint-water-app-20161211-story.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt;. You can read more about Wesley&amp;rsquo;s goals for MDST in this &lt;a href=&#34;http://eecs.umich.edu/eecs/about/articles/2018/mdst-2018.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; by the University of Michigan&amp;rsquo;s Computer Science Engineering department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, Wesley has worked on research and development at an Internet of things startup with &lt;a href=&#34;https://people.cs.umass.edu/~ruiwang/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rui Wang&lt;/a&gt;, machine learning research in healthcare with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wiensj/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Jenna Wiens&lt;/a&gt;, and philosophy in artificial intelligence with &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~rthomaso/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rich Thomason&lt;/a&gt;. Starting in high school, Wesley has also had numerous internships with companies such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dshine.com.cn/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Xuanliang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://rayshobby.net/wordpress/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RaysHobby&lt;/a&gt;, Fidelity Investments, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://clinc.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Clinc&lt;/a&gt;. This summer, he will be working at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wesley has been ranked 1st out of 205 students on a deep learning prediction challenge in University of Michigan&amp;rsquo;s Machine Learning course, placed 3rd in the world in MIT&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/view/assistmentsdatamining/data-mining-competition-2017/winners?authuser=0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ASSISTments Data Mining Competition&lt;/a&gt;, and received awards at multiple other hackathons. He has also been a recipient of the Chancellor&amp;rsquo;s Scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born in Mountain View, California, before Google was there, Wesley has transferred schools a total of nine times. In the process, he has relocated from California to Oregon, Taiwan, Shanghai, Massachusetts, and finally Michigan. He thanks these moves for his openness to different perspectives and helping form many of his own unique thoughts. Outside of school and work, he enjoys reading, writing, and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wesley has been a utilitarian and determinist since his teens. He once pursued a doctorate in machine learning research seriously until he realized he was competing against other peoples&amp;rsquo; strengths with his weakness–mathematics. His current pursuits are software engineering, political philosophy, and entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;
