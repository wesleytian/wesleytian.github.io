      <description>So, it seems like every few months I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling discontent with my personal website, thus prompting me to rehaul my website over and over again. This frequent rehauling can be boiled down to two reasons.
 I have never really felt satisfied with the overall design and aesthetic of my personal website.
 I haven&amp;rsquo;t made up my mind about starting my blog back up again or not.
  I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying around with Jekyll and Bootstrap recently, and then I found Hugo.</description>

      <description>In this short tutorial, you will be creating two repositories, one that will store your Hugo source files, and one that will store the files neccessary to view your website. The website repo is called public and will be inside of your source repository. This will be done by using a git submodule.
This guide requires you to have git installed, a Hugo website that you can easily clone from it&amp;rsquo;s github repo, and a GitHub account.</description>

      <description>Summary:  Command line AI that uses your play history to predict your next move in a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Built in Java. Uses Bayesian statistics.  Why Did I Build This? This project was built to showcase an AI technique that I learned from my AI course at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.
How Did I Build This? This project is built in Java and uses simple Bayesian statistics to predict the player&amp;rsquo;s next move by calculating the probability the player&amp;rsquo;s next move based on all previous moves and based on his/her previous K moves.</description>

      <title>How We Won $6000 at Our First Hackathon</title>

      <description>Summary:  Won most creative use of Indico API at Hamp Hack 2017. Awarded $2000/team member in API credits. Teammates: Nischal Tamang and Phillip Michalowski.  Why Did We Build This? Usually, project ideas are either spawned from day-to-day life or assigned. However, since we decided to go to a hackathon without any preplanning, we had to come up with an idea on the spot. I think this usually works pretty well, because you don&amp;rsquo;t actually know what the prizes are and that is what usually dictates what you are building.</description>

      <description>Wesley has a couple official roles, but in reality, those are just surface labels. Deep inside, he just wants to be happy and free, but just like seemingly everybody else these days, he is under society&amp;rsquo;s spell to do well in school and obtain a successful career. His long-term goal is to break that spell and truly disregard his own meta-judgment as well as others&amp;rsquo; judgments to live a free and fulfilling life that will also benefit mankind.</description>
